## My portfolio project ðŸŒ¸
Hi ! <br/>
I made this website to make it easier to access my resume. Also I tought it could be an interesting way to present it that way.<br/>
I developped it on React, and I tried to get a good-looking organisation.
You can find the link to my LinkedIn, a small introduction, my soft and hard skills, projects I worked on...<br/>

I hope you'll like it, please don't hesitate to send me a message if you want to know more about me.
