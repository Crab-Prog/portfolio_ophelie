## My portfolio project ðŸŒ¸
Hi ! <br/>
I made this website to make it easier to access my resume. Also I tought it could be an interesting way to present it that way.<br/>
I developped it on React, and I tried to get a good-looking organisation.
You can find the link to my LinkedIn, a small introduction, projects I worked on...<br/>
*Upcoming : Project 2 using react and an API (TheCocktailDB)*

I'm using the template from Wild Code School, because we're going to use it for our next project, in my opinion I think it's a good thing to start getting use to it as soon as possible!

I hope you'll like it, please don't hesitate to send me a message if you want to know more about me.
